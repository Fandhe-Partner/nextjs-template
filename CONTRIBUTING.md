## Commit Message Convention

We follow the Conventional Commits specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **type** and a **description**:

```
<type>: <description>
```

#### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Examples
```
feat: add dark mode support
fix: resolve styling issue in mobile view
docs: update README with new configuration options
style: format code according to Biome rules
```

### Guidelines
- Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
